Notetaking Services

If a student has a documented disability that interferes with the ability to access verbal and/or visual information, a notetaker will assist to ensure access to learning materials, making real-time classroom learning more accessible

Please approach a SEN Counsellor to work through this together

Access Arrangement
Parents and students are encouraged to consider the need to foster independence and work-ready skills when applying for Access Arrangement



Guidelines:

Access Arrangement may include extra time and/or separate room arrangement

Applicable to tests and/or examinations including practical (e.g. lab quiz)

Not applicable to project/oral presentation, assignment/project submission and internship given the nature of the assessment mode

NYP does not annotate Access Arrangement in the student transcript



Procedures:

Inform your respective school Course Manager or Personal Mentor (PEM) that you want to apply for Access Arrangement

Get ready the supporting documents (i.e. psychologist/ medical report) and get in touch with a SEN Counsellor

Once the Access Arrangement is approved, you will receive a notification from the Admissions & Academic Affairs Department

Access Arrangement will be applicable throughout the study years in NYP

If there is a course transfer, re-application is required



Note: Students in the Poly Foundation Programme will need to re-apply for Access Arrangement when they progress to Year 1

Internship Support
Internship is important to every student. At times, it may be challenging to secure suitable internship opportunities. A SEN Counsellor or school personnel may get in touch with parents/students when students are in Year 2 to discuss internship arrangements.



NYP works closely with agencies such as SG Enable, Trampolene and Inclus to increase the internship opportunity for Year 3 students to gain exposure to real-life work experience.
